Hello reader. This specific C program creates a function for several mathmatical operations. These include the following:
-ADD
-SUB
-MULTIPLY
-DIVIDE
-MODULUS
-SHIFT LEFT
-SHIFT RIGHT
-BITWISE AND
-BITWISE OR
-BITWISE XOR

two numbers (num1 and num2) are instantiated and then used in each function. Each function then returns a final number that is
the output. You can use the main function to set values to the two numbers and call the output of your desired function.
